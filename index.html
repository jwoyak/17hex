                    <h3>Music Projects</h3>
                    <p>I've been an electronic musician primarily focused on production and sound design since the 1990's. I work primarily in <a href="https://bitwig.com">Bitwig Studio</a> and with a small collection of hardware synthesizers. I have released ambient/experimental electronic as 17hex, and Industrial as Genome and Kether (as well as playing in several other bands in other genres!).</p>
                    <h4>17hex</h4>
                    <p>This is my longest running music project, with my use of this name going back to 2001 or so. Over the years I've released 17hex songs made in hardware (such as "Every Inside", made "in the box" on a Kurzweil K2000) and software (Buzz, Seq24, Caustic, Reaper, Ableton, Bitwig, and many others!).</p> 
                    <p>I've always released the 17hex songs for free on SoundCloud under a Creative Commons Attribution license in hopes that people would use it for something, to limited success. After a long break while I focused on other endeavors, I'm working to release a lot of new music soon!</p>
                    <h4>Kether</h4>
                    <p>Kether started back in the late 90's/early 2000's as a music project (Genome) with my brother Shawn, and later (mid-2000's) became a band with my friends Dave Eckblad and Tom Burt. We released two albums, with the first - 'Reality' - being partially genome songs we 'finished', and the second - 'Losses' - being the only music we wrote together as a band.</p>
                    <p>We were lucky enough to be part of the <a href="https://tcelectropunk.bandcamp.com/">Twin Cities Electropunk</a> scene, and played a number of shows at venues around the Twin Cities such as Club Underground, the Kitty Kat Club and Ground Zero. It was a wonderful experience with lots of great creative people, and mostly ended because everyone in the scene got busy with kids and careers and life, and social media's slow erosion of place-based scenes over the mid-aughts.</p>
                    <h4>Good Morning</h4>
                    <p>I got to play keyboards in an awesome hardcore punk band, Good Morning, with my friend Tom Burt. We played a LOT of shows (many in basements of punk houses, but also played all over the area), and it was a great experience.</p>
                    <p>I don't currently have digital copies of any of the music we released that I played on, but hopefully I can find it and put it online for posterity. We did physically release a few splits with other local punk bands, which is still the only time my music has been pressed on vinyl.</p>

                    <h3>Music Tools/Devices</h3>
                    <h4>Bitwig Presets</h4>
                    <p>I've created a collection of Bitwig presets that I use in my productions. These will be available for download soon.</p>
