SIGIL CREATOR by 17hex (web: http://17hex.com <> email: 17hex@protonmail.com)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChangeLog
---------
[Version 2.1]
The old 17hex.com site was lost, but after hearing from people that they
actually liked and used the sigil creator, I put in the work and was able
to mostly restore it! 

I was also able to restore the code for the v1 sigil
creator (written in PHP), but this site doesn't run PHP, so at least for now
it will stay offline.

Thanks so much to those of you who reached out to me asking me about the sigil
creator. It really means a lot that this project was useful to people!

[Version 2.0]
The sigil generator has been completeley rewritten for version 2.0!
Whereas before it was a server side application written in PHP and GD,
now it is a lean webapp written in pure HTML 5 canvas, CSS, and Javascript.
This means the app is faster, has more features, and (most importantly)
can now be used OFFLINE since all of the work is being done in your
web browser instead of on the server.

Features of version 2.0 are:
----------------------------
- javascript and HTML5 canvas is very lightweight and small
- WAY MORE FONTS (twice as many!) now with preview right in the chooser!
- Set the letter case (upper/lower/typed) for interesting combinations
- Set the font size with a slider (some fonts work better large/small/etc)
- Set the rotation amount (positive or negative) with a slider.
- Set colors now with slick color chooser!
- Ability to disable showing the sigilized letter set

Still to come:
--------------
- Ability to download an archive of the app to use offline on your device
- Maybe even an Android app. Really. I'm still working on this (again) :)
